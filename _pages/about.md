I work on applications of AI and computer vision methods in stroke imaging. My main focus is on Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA), but I also work with other imaging modalities. The goal of my project is to develop tools that can be used to inform decision-making during mechanical thrombectomy.

Within the [ICAI Stroke Lab](https://icai-stroke-lab.webflow.io/) I collaborate closely with my colleagues working on the application of AI methods in the different stages of the (Dutch) stroke care pathway. In addition to the Stroke Lab, I am also a member of the [Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam](https://bigr.nl/), in the Erasmus MC. 

I'm supervised by [dr. Theo van Walsum](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/research/researchers/walsum-theo-van), [prof. dr. Danny Ruijters](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/danny-ruijters), [dr. Ruisheng Su](https://ruishengsu.github.io/) and [dr. Sandra Cornelissen](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/nl-nl/patientenzorg/zorgverleners/cornelissen-sap). 

If you are a MSc student looking for a project (either an internship or a full thesis) don't hesitate to contact me.
