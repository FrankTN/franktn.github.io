I'm a PhD candidate at the [Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam](https://bigr.nl) and the [ICAI Stroke Lab](https://icai-stroke-lab.webflow.io/). 
I am supervised by Theo van Walsum, Danny Ruijters and Sandra Cornelissen. 

I have an MD from the University of Groningen and an MSc in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence Technology track) 
from the TU Delft. Additionally, I have experience working as a junior doctor in internal medicine at the HagaZiekenhuis.

The main goal of the ICAI Stroke Lab is to optimize outcomes along the entire stroke care pathway, from the prehospital 
stage to rehabilitation. We do this by developing explainable and reliable AI systems capable of assisting clinicians 
and related personnel during their decision-making process. Within this context my main focus is on the development of 
AI tools for neurointerventional image-analysis.
